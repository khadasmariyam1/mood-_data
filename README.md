# Pre-Disease Emotional & Physical Pattern Dataset

This dataset is a unique initiative by **Reshma** to document **emotional and physical symptom patterns** observed **before the diagnosis of rare diseases**. It aims to support researchers, AI/ML developers, and healthcare professionals in building intelligent models that consider emotional health as an early indicator.

## Why This Dataset?

Most datasets only focus on physical symptoms. This one is special because it includes:
- Emotional states before diagnosis (like anxiety, sadness, irritability)
- Lifestyle indicators (sleep, cravings)
- Menstrual health patterns (for women)
- Final diagnosis (rare or hard-to-detect conditions)

## Project Vision

This project is a **first phase** in developing a new predictive model for rare disease detection using emotional cues. The aim is to eventually **patent** this concept with deeper data and AI collaboration.

## Dataset Details

- Format: Excel (.xlsx)
- Total Entries: 10 (simulated real-world observations)
- Fields: Age, Gender, Location, Date, Physical Symptoms, Emotional State, Sleep, Craving, Menstrual Issues, Final Diagnosis

## How to Use

You can use this dataset to:
- Build predictive models in healthcare
- Run emotional analysis before medical events
- Combine with Kaggle data to expand research

## License

This dataset is free for academic and research use. Please credit **Reshma (Original Creator)** when using this in any paper, model, or publication.
